# 645FinalProj - UNLMTD
Nadir Ali

The project is making a workout app that will tell the customer what type of workout they should have based on their goals. For example, if they want to lose muscle have 40 minutes of time to workout and have an injury, it will create a custom workout for the user. With future implementations, it'll be connected to an Apple watch, fitbit or even our own hardware that can track information like heartbeat, hydration levels, quality and length of sleep as these all play a factor in the type of workout someone should have.
